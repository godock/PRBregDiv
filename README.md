# Phase retrieval with Bregman divergences GitHub repository
You will find here the code related to the _Phase retrieval with Bregman divergences and application to audio signal recovery_ article. Please cite the [corresponding paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00392) if you use any piece of this work. Audio examples of reconstructed signals are available [online](https://magronp.github.io/demos/jstsp21.html).

To run the phase retrieval experiment with exact spectrograms, please run the ``main_PR.py`` script. For the phase retrieval experiment with modified spectrograms, please run ``main_PRMod.py``.
Figures can be generated with ``plotter_PR.py`` and ``plotter_PRMod.py`` scripts.
